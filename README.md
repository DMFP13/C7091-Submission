Overview
This repository contains my submission for the "Professional Skills for Data Science" module assignment. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate proficiency in R programming, data visualization, and GitHub usage for version control and digital content creation. The assignment is broken down into problem sets based on the themes covered in the module: R Language, GitHub and Markdown, Tidy Data, and Statistics Reporting.

Deliverables
This repository contains two main deliverables:

Quarto Document (.qmd):

This document includes solutions to all problem sets provided in the course.
Each solution contains commented R code that demonstrates the process used to answer each question.
The document is designed for easy readability and contains explanations for each step in the code, helping showcase my approach to solving the problems.

HTML Output (.html): viewable here:

This is the rendered version of the Quarto document, providing a clear, accessible display of the answers and code.
The HTML output ensures that the content is accessible without needing to run the code.
Repository Contents
Problem_Sets.qmd: The main Quarto document containing the problem set solutions, with inline comments for each line of code.
Problem_Sets.html: The rendered HTML output of the Quarto document for easy viewing. I was unable to publish this appropriately in GitHub hence the additional rpub links

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

The code was written using R, and the relevant pacjkages required to run the code are listed at the top of the .qmd files.

dplyr: For data manipulation.
ggplot2: For data visualization.
quarto: For document compilation and rendering.
