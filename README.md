Overview
This repository contains my submission for the "Professional Skills for Data Science" module assignment. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate proficiency in R programming, data visualization, and GitHub usage for version control and digital content creation. The assignment is broken down into problem sets based on the themes covered in the module: R Language, GitHub and Markdown, Tidy Data, and Statistics Reporting.

Deliverables
This repository contains two main deliverables:

Quarto Document (.qmd):

This document includes solutions to all problem sets provided in the course.
Each solution contains commented R code that demonstrates the process used to answer each question.
I have struggled with the statistical elements of this assignment but hope that this contains reasonable explanations for each step in the code and my approach to solving the problems.

HTML Output (.html): viewable here:

This is the rendered versions of the Quarto document whioch hopefully provide clear, accessible display of the answers and code.
The HTML output ensures that the content is accessible without needing to run the code.
